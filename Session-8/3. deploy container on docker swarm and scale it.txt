3. Deploy a docker Container on a docker Swarm
------------------------------------------------

docker swarm: managing multiple containers running on diffrent host.

Wehere we will intialize a swarm that node will become leader node

other node can join to this node and you can use them as worker node.

set the permission:

>sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

Step 1: initialize a docker swarm

	>docker swarm init (machine will become leader node)
	>docker node ls
	(see the status of your node)

step 2: create service in this docker swarm

	>docker service create -p 80:80 --name myservice myimage

	you can see the application running on port 80: --> publicIp:80

	>curl localhost:80

	See the running service

	>docker service ls

**********************************************************************************
Scale a Docker container on a docker swarm

>docker service ls
>docker service ps myservice (name of your service)

Scale 

>docker service scale myservice=3
>docker service ls
>docker service ps myservice
