Let's inititalize swarm cluster

>docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.10.106 (PrivateIP of master node)

your master node will become leader and you must seen one tokwn available that you can use to join from other nodes.

execute that token command from worker node to joiin swarm as a worker

>sudo docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3dztt7ter5i7rdrkjalmuzpo9ji1jok0q6noibxwtixvjerh8h-4nhbfufzobn2e9id2zgbph4wy 172.31.10.106:2377

go to master node cli

and execute below command to check node status

>sudo docker node ls

(you can see master node manegerial status as leader and worker node blank)

create Service with 2 replicas.
--------------------------------------------------

execute docker login command from both the nodes so you can run the image which is svailable on your docker HUB

_________________________________________________________


>sudo docker service create --name clusterservice --publish 8081:8081 --replicas 2 sonamsoni/firstimage


>sudo docker service ps clusterservice

check one service is running on workernode and another is runnig on masternode
